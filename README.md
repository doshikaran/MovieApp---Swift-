# Movie Explorer

Movie Explorer is my first iOS application developed using Swift. It provides a list of the latest, upcoming, popular, and top-rated movies. You can search for your desired movie and get detailed information about it, including the name, image, genre, duration, description, cast, directors, and producers. The app also allows you to watch trailers by redirecting you to YouTube.

## Features

- Browse a vast collection of movies: The app provides lists of the latest, upcoming, popular, and top-rated movies.
- Search functionality: Easily find your desired movie by searching through the movie database.
- Movie details: View detailed information about a movie, including its name, image, genre, duration, description, cast, directors, and producers.
- Trailer playback: Watch trailers of movies by seamlessly redirecting to YouTube.
